#  Iris Flower Classification
This project is a machine learning model to classify **Iris flower species** (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

##  Problem Statement

The goal is to build a classification model that can predict the species of an Iris flower using the famous **Iris dataset**. It's a beginner-friendly project used to understand supervised learning and classification algorithms.
